3. No server or installation is required—everything runs locally in your browser.

## Tools/Frameworks Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Used for structure and styling. No frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind) were used to allow for full custom branding and design control.
- **Google Fonts**: For the script font in the hero section.

This project is fully static and easy to customize. Replace images in the `images/` folder to update the branding or drinks.
